Including side-channel vulnerability assessment in the validation process

### Description

When creating advanced, powerful, or high-stakes AI systems, security-validated software engineering practices are called for. Given that vulnerabilities can use a growing array of unexpected side-channels ([Guri et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05915)), and given that advanced agents can be more creative about side-channel use than people are, a side-channel vulnerability assessment would be important to such validation, yet it wouldn't be able to provide any guarantees.
