Utilizing a stack of verified software as high as is practical

### Description

Because software verification and correct-by-construction are such powerful techniques to reduce the kinds of implementation issues that are often exploited during security events, utilizing a stack of as much verified software, as high as is practical in the stack, would be prudent. Even just very well-tested underlying platform can provide similar benefits, e.g. the DARPA SAFE program aims to build an integrated hardware-software system with a flexible metadata rule engine ([DeHon et al. 2011](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1707&context=cis_papers)), on which can be built memory safety, fault isolation, and other protocols that could improve security by preventing exploitable flaws ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)).
