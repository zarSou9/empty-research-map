Utilizing advanced automated intelligence capabilities to protect the AI system against exploits and intrusion

### Description

For advanced and general purpose agents, it should be quite possible to utilize its own advanced automation and intelligence analysis capabilities to, analyze potential malware ([Rieck et al. 2011](http://www.mlsec.org/malheur/docs/malheur-jcs.pdf)), protect itself against active exploits, detect intrusions ([Lane 2000](https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/assets/pdf/bibtex_archive/98-11.pdf)), and automatically check for potential exploits it may be vulnerable to. As AI matures, AIs one wishes to keep good will also need to protect themselves against not just human hackers, but also AIs that have either become, or were designed to be, bad ([Pistono and Yampolskiy 2016](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1605/1605.02817.pdf)). Likewise, both context-aware and narrow AIs will need to protect the security and privacy of others they are serving, so an understanding and application of differential privacy ([Zhang et al. 2016a](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/viewFile/12129/11885), [Tossou and Dimitrakakis 2016](http://www.aaai.org/Library/AAAI/aaai16contents.php)) practices would be called for ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)).
