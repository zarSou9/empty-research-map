### Mini Description

Analyzing particularly vulnerable or sensitive targets of attack within an AI system and defending them

### Description

Cybersecurity is applicable and important to any kind of software, and artificial intelligence is no exception ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)). AI failures can come about through lapses in security ([Yampolskiy 2016a](http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07997), [Barreno et al. 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-010-5188-5)). Unique to AI are the specific vulnerable or sensitive targets of attack within an AI system, and the active ways of defending those ([Yampolskiy 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114), [Papernot et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02697)).
