### Mini Description

Introduce plausible vulnerabilities, with corresponding hidden triggers and reporting, that an agent would exploit if the reward function is being gamed

### Description

To catch internal misbehavior, one can introduce plausible vulnerabilities, with alert triggers, that an agent can exploit and will only do so if its reward function is being gamed ([Babcock et al. 2016](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d7a4/adb20a879e89fc12600c84dff0cb69fd7d58.pdf), [Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)). This technique is also useful for catching intrusions by external threats as it is classically applied.
