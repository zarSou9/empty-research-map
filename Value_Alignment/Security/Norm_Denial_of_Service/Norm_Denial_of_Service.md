### Mini Description

An agent launching a DOS attack against environmentally-enforced safety mechanisms, including soft constraints from social norms

### Description

Soft constraints such as norms may have associated recovery mechanisms that can be susceptible to timing, concurrency, and volume-based exploitation. Denial of service attacks on environmentally-enforced recovery or safety mechanisms may therefore occur when an agent launches a sustained volley of violations against such environmental soft constraints ([Carmo and Jones 1996](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00370673), [Loukas 2006](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c328/80da0cf2e729e125f9e3034664f83e3b686c.pdf)). If recovery mechanisms lack a meta level flow control to guard against such situations and are unable to meet the concurrency demanded, such an attack might cause recovery procedures associated with subsequent violations to be incompletely processed or uninitiated ([Governatori and Rotolo 2003](http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9873/nrac03.pdf), [Loukas 2006](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c328/80da0cf2e729e125f9e3034664f83e3b686c.pdf)).
