### Mini Description

General techniques for agents to respond to adversarial testing and manipulation

### Description

In online scenarios where actual adversaries may provide very skewed or poisoned data, it can be imperative that the agent not be corrupted by that ([Huang et al. 2011](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2046684.2046692), [Neff and Nagy 2016](http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/6277/1804)). There is a growing literature on learning in a manner that is robust to such adversaries ([Huang et al. 2011](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2046684.2046692)).
