### Mini Description

Intelligently managing trust of other agents based on their behavior

### Description

In order to determine which sources of information, or which agents, in an environment can be trusted, techniques that analyze those entities' behaviors statistically may be employed ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)). Intelligently managing trust in this manner can be applied to other AI systems ([Probst and Kasera 2007](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~kasera/myPapers/trust.pdf)), and generally, reputation models ([Sabater and Sierra 2005](http://www.iiia.csic.es/files/pdfs/1035.pdf)) allow such mechanisms to scale ([Neff and Nagy 2016](http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/6277/1804)).
