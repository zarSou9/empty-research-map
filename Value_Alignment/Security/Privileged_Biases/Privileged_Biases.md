### Mini Description

Pretrained or specified biases can be weighed higher than others, allowed narrower tolerances, allowed to change more slowly, or have triggers informing of attacks or adversarial pressures on it

### Description

Specific biases, relationship valences, or soft or hard constraints within an agent's world model can be annotated as privileged and weighted highly in tradeoff calculations ([Tanner and Medin 2004](http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2FBF03206481.pdf)). These may model values. Such biases can be allowed narrower tolerances, allowed to change more slowly, or have associated triggers informing the agent of adversarial pressures or attacks on them ([Tabibian et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07472v2), [Baskaran et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02737v2), [Li et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02463v2)).
