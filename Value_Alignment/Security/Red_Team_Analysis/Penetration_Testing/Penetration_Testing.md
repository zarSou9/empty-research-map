### Description

Penetration testing specifically uses an adversarial entity to attempt to break into the system of interest in various ways and to go as deeply into its systems as possible. Agents can analyze the vulnerabilities of other systems and agents in this way ([Brun and Ernst 2004](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/machlearn-errors-icse2004.pdf)), and can correlate this analysis with analyses of the likely source code generating those vulnerabilities.
