### Description

Red team analysis uses an adversarial entity or team to probe and identify vulnerabilities in the system of interest, usually in a blackbox context. The recent DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge likewise had various automated adversarial teams whitebox scan their own systems and blackbox scan their opponents, patch themselves, develop exploits, and penetrate opponent systems, all in a matter of minutes rather than the weeks to months that humans would normally take for the same steps ([Song and Alves-Foss 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jim_Alves-Foss/publication/286490027_The_DARPA_cyber_grand_challenge_A_competitor%27s_perspective/links/56778d1908ae502c99d30b3c), [Musca 2016](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/116/archive/fall2016/jmusca.pdf)).
