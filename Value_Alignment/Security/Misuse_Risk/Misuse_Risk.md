How to deal with the risk of operators misusing an advanced agent

### Description

Another type of security risk is that a highly capable agent can be misused by its operators ([Yampolskiy 2016b](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW16/paper/download/12566/12356)). There may well be technical strategies, e.g. requiring a large number of operators or sources of values, to help mitigate this risk, but this is very underexplored.
