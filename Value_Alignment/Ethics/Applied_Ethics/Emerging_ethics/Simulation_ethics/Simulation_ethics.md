Studies the ethics of emulating and instantiating minds on computers and what we ought to do should we find ourselves in such a simulation.

### Description

While not pertinent today or in the short term, powerful AI systems may one day be able to run world simulations populated by sentient beings, generate artificial minds, and may also make crucial breakthroughs in cosmogony that reveal we are within the context of a simulation.
