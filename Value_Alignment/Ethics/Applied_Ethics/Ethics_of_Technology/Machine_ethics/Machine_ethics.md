### Mini Description

Studies morality and how to implement it in robots and AI.

### Description

There exists disagreement over whether or not machine ethics is currently the right approach to generating value-aligned AI, or if it ever will be (Yampolskiy 2012). It may be very difficult or impossible to take control back from deployed autonomous AI systems with some form of machine ethics. Similarly, its not clear how we will be able to modify AI systems behavior and ethics should we wish to improve upon it. On the other hand, the dream of many AI researchers is the deployment of fully autonomous, moral AI systems which could take jobs that are both undesirable and dangerous (Anderson and Anderson, 2011). If we are serious about developing human-level artificial intelligence, truly autonomous systems, or super intelligence, then it is clear that we must get our meta and normative ethical theories straight and find out the most secure and robust way of instantiating it in AI through top-down, bottom-up, or mixed approaches (Wallach 2009).
