### Mini Description

Is a still developing area of research and technology which attempts to create devices and machines which function at the molecular and atomic scales.

### Description

Advanced nanotechnology could have enormous consequences for life on Earth. In its most benign and beneficial forms, nanotechnology can be used in medicine to deliver drugs, for optimizing fuel cells and batteries, and fuels, and in assisting space flight through novel materials. In its worst, nanotechnology can be used for military applications and for delivering poisons. We should be careful to consider the AI research space and avoid or guard areas which may pose serious information hazards for developing malevolent nanotech.
