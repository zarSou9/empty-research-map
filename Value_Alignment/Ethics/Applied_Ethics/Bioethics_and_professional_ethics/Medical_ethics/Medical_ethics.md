### Description

Central to medical ethics is the Hippocratic Oath, which lays the foundational principles for medical professionals. This foundation of medical ethics is built upon non-discrimination of persons due to background and a respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice. As more powerful AI systems are generated and give us more causal efficacy over sick persons, questions will continue to arise regarding the ethical use of new technologies with respect to these principles. As these AI systems become more autonomous and intelligent in the medical system, it will  be important to ensure the ethical foundations of medicine are embodied and fulfilled.
