Preventing extremely low-probability high-reward choices

### Description

In order to prevent extremely low-probability high-reward choices, carefully normalizing rewards or utilities at a level appropriate to the agent ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)) is in order. Concomitantly, model uncertainty should dominate most expert calculations that involve small probabilities ([Ord et al. 2010](http://www.amirrorclear.net/files/probing-the-improbable.pdf)).
