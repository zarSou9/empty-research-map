Having the reward function itself be an agent that tries to find flawed value determinations

### Description

In order to enable a more active, critical, and responsive reward function, one can have the reward function itself be an agent that tries to find flawed value determinations, similar to how generative adversarial networks work ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565), [Goodfellow et al. 2014](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets)).
