Environmental goals refer to the structuring of a reward system such that an agent that would fool its sensors into registering otherwise-high-reward data would not actually receive a high reward ([Dewey 2011](http://www.danieldewey.net/learning-what-to-value.pdf), [Hibbard 2012a](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6b2b/f1efaa66c77677070f1c52701f0f7f2a3e15.pdf), [Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf), [Everitt and Hutter 2016](http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783319416489-c2.pdf), [Dewey 2014](http://www.danieldewey.net/reward-engineering-principle.pdf)).
