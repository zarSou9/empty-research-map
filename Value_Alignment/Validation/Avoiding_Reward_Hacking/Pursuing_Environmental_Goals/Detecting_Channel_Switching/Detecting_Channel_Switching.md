### Mini Description

Apply anomaly detection to normally slow-changing features to detect incongruencies

### Description

The entry of an agent into wireheading may be indicated by percept disjointedness. Delusional hallucination might therefore be avoided using "slow features" to detect incongruences or discontinuities that are indicative of a percept-channel switching event ([Wiskott and Sejnowski 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11936959)). This involves the application of anomaly detection to normally slow-changing features to detect such segmentation ([Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)). Note that this issue is very different from either the hallucinations of "inceptionism" ([Mordvintsev et al. 2015](https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html)) used for transparency into deep networks or the sorts of imaginings that generative networks ([Zhang et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03242v1)) do to produce exemplars.
