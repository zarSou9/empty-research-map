### Mini Description

Formalizing detection and prevention of reward hacking, e.g. by analyzing the distance and shape of jumps in the feature space

### Description

Independent of specific techniques, formalization and study of reward hacking by analyzing the distance and shape of jumps in the feature space would help to generalize its detection and avoidance ([Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)).
