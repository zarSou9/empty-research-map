### Mini Description

Shaping the direction of optimization pressures to allow optimization of certain variables in the environment without trying to optimize others

### Description

By maintaining the independence of variables actually valued, the system can shape the direction of the optimization pressures to areas one cares less about maintaining to moderate values ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)).
