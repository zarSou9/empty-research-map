### Mini Description

Specific disorder or symptom analogues and common features between natural and artificial versions

### Description

Within each corresponding pair, generalizing some key dynamics of the problem, and optionally some subset of the treatment for the psychological condition, may lead to insights applicable to such issues with artificial agents. A particularly promising application of analyzing these natural-artificial analogues is to mine insights about analogous issues from each domain that may be applicable to the other domain (Bach 2016). Indeed many of the dysfunctions that can affect naturally developed minds have close counterparts in synthetic intelligences, and vice versa ([Ashrafian 2016](http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11948-016-9783-0.pdf), Mallah 2017). By characterizing these correspondences more specifically ([Sun 2012](http://cognet.mit.edu/book/grounding-social-sciences-cognitive-sciences), [Ring and Orseau 2011](http://people.idsia.ch/~ring/AGI-2011/Paper-B.pdf), [Nikolic 2014](http://ac.els-cdn.com/S002251931500106X/1-s2.0-S002251931500106X-main.pdf?_tid=6f1c2bc8-c4e7-11e6-972c-00000aacb35e&acdnat=1482041076_291e3fa094036bcad0f5601cfc975933), [French 1993](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/799-catastrophic-interference-in-connectionist-networks-can-it-be-predicted-can-it-be-prevented.pdf), [Rusu et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04671v3)), researchers might be able to find insights from the field of psychology and apply them to AI, or, in the interest of furthering science, helping people, and strengthening bridges across these fields, perhaps find insights from AI safety and translate them into insights psychologists can use.
