Psychology-inspired safety approaches for blackbox brain emulation techniques

### Description

Psychological analogues to AI are relevant not only for engineered AI but also for scanned and emulated biological brains. Though neuroscientists understand much of what occurs in such detailed and bioplausible neural networks, that understanding is at the level of annotations rather than being able to produce a detailed explanatory or generative model. This may lead us to treat the emulation as a black box, and so psychology-derived AI safety approaches and characterizations would become quite relevant ([Sandberg and Bostrom 2008](http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/3853/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf)).
