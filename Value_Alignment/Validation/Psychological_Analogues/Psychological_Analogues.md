Establishing correlates between natural cognition and artificial cognition to transfer insights in both directions

### Description

Artificial intelligences, including organizations and AI agents, and natural intelligences, including animals and humans, share a number of features in common ([Sun 2005](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/psychology/cognition/cognition-and-multi-agent-interaction-cognitive-modeling-social-simulation?format=HB&isbn=9780521839648)). Information processing, knowledge processing, planning, and action are at the core of all of these classes of intelligent agent. In many cases, even when architectures are appreciably different, similar dynamics can occur, both in the proper and improper processing of knowledge ([Goodman and Tenenbaum 2016](http://probmods.org/v2), [Sun 2012](http://cognet.mit.edu/book/grounding-social-sciences-cognitive-sciences)). Though interesting, what motivates cross-modality analysis is that establishing correlates, analogues, or metaphors that run deep between natural cognition and artificial cognition might enable us to harvest and transfer insights in both directions between psychology (even organizational psychology and animal psychology) and artificial intelligence safety research.
