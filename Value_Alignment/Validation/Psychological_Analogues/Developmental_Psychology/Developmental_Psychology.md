Utilizing parallels between human early childhood learning and development and grown, learned, or seed artificial cognitive systems

### Description

Within the field of artificial general intelligence, and with some precursor machine learning techniques, parallels are drawn between human early childhood learning and development and seed artificial cognitive systems that are either grown or learned ([Steunebrink et al. 2016](http://people.idsia.ch/~steunebrink/Publications/AGI16_growing_recursive_self-improvers.pdf), [Jara-Ettinger et al. 2013](https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0141/index.html), [Tenenbaum et al. 2011](https://web.stanford.edu/~ngoodman/papers/tkgg-science11-reprint.pdf), [Goertzel et al. 2014](http://www.springer.com/in/book/9789462390263)). Questions remain open as to how far this metaphor extends, particularly with respect to architectures that are not intended to be biologically plausible.
