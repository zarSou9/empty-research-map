### Mini Description

Establishing which general classes of analogues can be valid

### Description

One can more broadly analyze human cognition and developmental psychology in terms of machine learning algorithms and vice versa to potentially elucidate fruitful avenues of research ([Baker et al. 2011](http://aiweb.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/aiweb/media/papers/cogsci2011.pdf), [Goodman and Tenenbaum 2016](http://probmods.org/v2), [Jara-Ettinger et al. 2016](http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/pdf/S1364-6613(16)30124-3.pdf), [Tenenbaum et al. 2011](https://web.stanford.edu/~ngoodman/papers/tkgg-science11-reprint.pdf), [Jara-Ettinger et al. 2013](https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0141/index.html)). In so doing, the field should want to establish which general classes of analogues can be valid, for which architectures, and to what extent ([Sun 2012](http://cognet.mit.edu/book/grounding-social-sciences-cognitive-sciences)), and this can benefit from additional research.
