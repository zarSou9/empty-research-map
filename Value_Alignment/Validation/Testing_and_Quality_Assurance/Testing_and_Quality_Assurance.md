Finding scalable analogues to software engineering quality assurance paradigms

### Description

Traditional software quality assurance techniques will not scale well with highly capable AI, but they can still be deployed to provide early and efficient warnings about robustness or safety issues, and analogues to these techniques can be helpful. Unit tests, for instance, can perform some basic checks of sanity and deception. To extend such tests toward the realm of general-purpose agents, a task theory and framework is necessary ([Thorisson et al. 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-41649-6_12)). These analogues will not be nearly sufficient to maintain safety in the traditional quality control paradigm, hence the other safety techniques here ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)).
