### Mini Description

Specifying firm core values upfront, and using those to evaluate derived instrumental value candidates

### Description

To strike a balance between specified and learned values, one can structure a mechanism of ethical constraints of variable softness. Core values specified upfront would be rather firm, and instrumental or derivative values, preferences, and actions would be built and learned atop them, and evaluated against them ([Tanner and Medin 2004](http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2FBF03206481.pdf)), with incremental layers featuring incrementally softer and more malleable constraints ([Steunebrink et al. 2016](http://people.idsia.ch/~steunebrink/Publications/AGI16_growing_recursive_self-improvers.pdf), Mallah 2017, [Wallach et al. 2010](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01095.x/epdf)).
