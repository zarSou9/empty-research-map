### Mini Description

The development of effective ethical systems within multiagent systems

### Description

An approach to growing ethical systems is to use mechanism design, setting up an environment with multiple agents, and incentives and punishments, to direct norms and preferences of the agents toward cooperation ([Busoniu et al. 2008](http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:4c7d3b49-06fc-400c-923e-3903b8d230fe/busoniu2008.pdf), [Conn 2016a](http://futureoflife.org/2016/09/26/training-artificial-intelligence-compromise/), [Rossi 2016](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2016/6187/pdf/LIPIcs-CONCUR-2016-2.pdf)). Unfortunately, in the limit, such evolution is by no means guaranteed to reach a desirable or context-insensitive state (Hall 2011). Evolutionary development in general, however, can lead to unexpected results that are undesirably specific to incidental environmental factors ([Bird and Layzell 2002](https://people.duke.edu/~ng46/topics/evolved-radio.pdf)).
