### Mini Description

Modeling and leveraging the trades that occur between agents that disagree about morals but trade in order to each increase their moral impact

### Description

Within such systems, one dynamic of note is that moral agents that disagree about morals will tend to trade to increase their moral impact ([Ord 2015](http://amirrorclear.net/files/moral-trade.pdf)). Another recent concept of note is ethical fusion, in which aggregation in collective and collaborative decision making occurs not via linear combination but effectively through negotiating synergies ([Greene et al. 2016](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12457/12204), [Rossi 2016](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2016/6187/pdf/LIPIcs-CONCUR-2016-2.pdf)).
