### Mini Description

The use of urges, drives, affects, and emotions in artificial agents to effect moral behavior

### Description

Some seek to keep agents benign through artificial feelings and needs, similarly to how animals modulate their prosocial tendencies ([Goertzel et al. 2014](http://www.springer.com/in/book/9789462390263), [Bach 2011](http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2011/464/presentations/Bach.pdf), [Dehghani et al. 2011](http://ict.usc.edu/pubs/Machine%20Ethics.pdf)). For approaches that seek maximal biological plausibility, cognitive neuroscience offers significant bearing on the formulation and evaluation of ethics ([Greene 2014](https://joshgreene.squarespace.com/s/beyond-point-and-shoot-morality-a4h2.pdf)).
