### Mini Description

Techniques and constructs that enable the representation of multiple kinds of ethical theories to be modelled in the same conceptual space simultaneously

### Description

Having a harmonized space in which different major or important ethical systems can be represented, e.g. vector or tensor spaces, or graph traversal spaces, might allow for efficient set theoretic operations across them, facilitating ensemble and multiobjective approaches, but this is rather underexplored as yet ([Greene et al. 2016](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12457/12204), Mallah 2017).
