Retrospective and prospective mechanisms for developing and using values

### Description

Combining retrospective and prospective perspectives would seem a good desideratum for ethical contemplation. One such joint representation and evaluation mechanism for developing and using values is to assign value to choices by a combination of intrinsic value, based on past experience, and from an internally represented causal model of the world ([Cushman 2013](http://cushmanlab.fas.harvard.edu/docs/cushman_2013.pdf)). There can also be combinations of hard and soft constraints, conflict resolution, and consistency mechanisms over multiple layers of values, ethics, morals, and preferences ([Greene et al. 2016](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12457/12204), [Rossi 2016](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2016/6187/pdf/LIPIcs-CONCUR-2016-2.pdf)).
