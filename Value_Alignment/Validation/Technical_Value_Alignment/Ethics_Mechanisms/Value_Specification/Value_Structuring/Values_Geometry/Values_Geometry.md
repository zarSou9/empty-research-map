### Mini Description

Geometrical, graphical, and ontological analyses of how values can be structured

### Description

The way that value-related concepts, relationships, and skills are represented may heavily influence the dynamics of their use. What the basic data structures, or even theoretical ontological structures, of ethical and moral values are is not yet a settled question though. Some schemes model values as worth attached to ontological properties and relationships, providing a range for preferences ([Greene et al. 2016](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12457/12204), [Rossi 2016](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2016/6187/pdf/LIPIcs-CONCUR-2016-2.pdf), Mallah 2017). There have been computational explorations of how human values should be conceived of and modeled (Sotala 2016, [Rossi 2016a](https://intelligence.org/files/csrbai/pref-eth1.pdf)). There may also be cartesian and monte carlo tree search graph search algorithm constructs of values which might be well-suited to efficient ethical ensembles ([Bnaya et al. 2015](www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS15/paper/view/11273/10648), Mallah 2017).
