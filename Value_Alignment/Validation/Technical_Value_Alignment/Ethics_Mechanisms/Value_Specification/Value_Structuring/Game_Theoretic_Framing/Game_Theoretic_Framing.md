### Mini Description

Enhancing game theoretic constructs to support prosocial values

### Description

Putting common notions of morality into a game theoretic framework in order to support propagation of prosocial values and equilibria is a promising, if early, framing ([Letchford et al. 2008](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-92185-1_75), [Conitzer et al. 2017](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~conitzer/moralAAAI17.pdf)). Evolving ethical systems, however, does not yet provide many guarantees as to success or applicability (Hall 2011), and so research into the differential robustness of such solutions when the mechanism is modified may be beneficial.
