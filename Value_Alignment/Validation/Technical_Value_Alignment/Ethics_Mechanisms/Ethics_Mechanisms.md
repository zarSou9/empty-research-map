Methods by which to imbue values into a system

### Description

There are multiple methods to represent such values and to imbue them into artificial agents. Different orders of complexity of AI systems will have different capacities and mechanisms to represent values ([Steinhardt 2015](https://jsteinhardt.wordpress.com/2015/06/24/long-term-and-short-term-challenges-to-ensuring-the-safety-of-ai-systems/), Mallah 2017). Highly capable and general AIs will require more sophisticated treatments of values.
