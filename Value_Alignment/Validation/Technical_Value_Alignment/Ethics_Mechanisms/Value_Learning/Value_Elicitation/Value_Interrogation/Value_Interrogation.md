### Mini Description

Methods for querying or detecting values from sources of values

### Description

The set of methods for querying or detecting values from sources of values is called value interrogation. Depending on the way one wishes learned values to be structured and how directly those should be learned, mechanisms for querying authorized sources of values can appropriately vary considerably, ranging from asking, to watching, to scanning ([Boutilier 2002](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2002/AAAI02-037.pdf), [Soares 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/ValueLearningProblem.pdf), [Tarleton 2010](https://intelligence.org/files/CEV-MachineEthics.pdf), [Potapov and Rodionov 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0702v1)). Techniques for maximal extraction of alignment-oriented information will also include robust counterfactual elicitation. The field of preference elicitation ([Chen and Pu 2004](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/52659/files/IC_TECH_REPORT_200467.pdf)) likely has much to offer that of the rather related value elicitation.
