### Mini Description

Collaboration among multiple agents with interrogation, joint trial-and-error, disambiguation, and value factoring, in order to uncover the reward function of a subset of the agents

### Description

Learning of instrumental or potentially terminal values can be done in a collaborative manner, whereby multiple agents interrogate each other, perform joint trial-and-error episodes, and preemptively disambiguate concepts or events for each other in order to uncover the reward function of a target subset of the agents ([Hadfield-Menell et al. 2016](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dhm/papers/CIRL_NIPS_16.pdf)).
