Learning baseline policies in an apprenticeship manner and exploring with bounded deviations from demonstrations

### Description

Another method of safely learning from observing humans is to learn baseline policies in an apprenticeship manner and explore with bounded deviations from demonstrations ([Ross et al. 2011](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v15/ross11a/ross11a.pdf), [Abbeel and Ng 2005](http://ai.stanford.edu/~pabbeel//pubs/AbbeelNg_eaalirl_ICML2005.pdf), [Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565), [Finn et al. 2016a](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/finn16.pdf)). It may however be difficult to learn deep preferences this way.
