Learning by observing and imitating instructive human behavior

### Description

One way to convey to artificial agents what one would like them to do is to show them in detail. Designing and training machine learning systems to effectively imitate humans who are engaged in complex and difficult tasks is an area of active research ([Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)). One important consideration in this approach is the set of tradeoffs between the depth of true objectives one would ideally like to uncover and the ease with which shorter-term goals or instrumental goals can be learned ([Christiano 2015](https://medium.com/ai-control/ambitious-vs-narrow-value-learning-99bd0c59847e)).
