### Description

Some techniques focus on having a measure of the robustness of human imitation within the contexts learned, such as those quantifying the sampling needed for preference inference ([Laskey et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00850.pdf), [Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)).
