Using GANs to train a system to generate human-like answers to within some statistical confidence

### Description

Generative adversarial networks may be able to train a system to generate human-like answers to within some statistical confidence ([Goodfellow et al. 2014](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets), [Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)).
