### Mini Description

Representations of the world or environment in a hierarchical or a holistic manner

### Description

Reality and possibility are very large. Multilevel conceptualizations therefore arise, whether implicitly or explicitly, in the layers of a deep net, in systems biology, in meta vs. upper vs. lower vs. operational ontologies, in variational renormalization in physics ([Lin and Tegmark 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.08225v1.pdf)), and in multilevel analysis in statistics ([Snijders and Bosker 2011](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/multilevel-analysis/book234191)). A key question for AI safety is how multi-level world-models can be constructed from sense data in a manner amenable to ontology identification ([Soares 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/ValueLearningProblem.pdf), [Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)).
