### Mini Description

The structure and techniques for representing concepts, relationships, and processes, in support of activities like reasoning and recall

### Description

Conceptual spaces, be they vector spaces, semantic networks, more implicit subsymbolic structures, or symbolic-subsymbolic hybrid representations, are how concepts are defined, grounded, and related to each other ([Gardenfors 2000](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/conceptual-spaces)). Any ontology, including implicit ones in subsymbolic architectures, is biased by the faculties with which it was constructed and intended (Sotala 2015, [Gardenfors 2000](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/conceptual-spaces)).
