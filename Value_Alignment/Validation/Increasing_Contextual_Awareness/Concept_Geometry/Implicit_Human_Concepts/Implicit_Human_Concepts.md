### Mini Description

The structure or shape of how humans represent concepts

### Description

Beyond the realism of concepts, a possible desideratum for enhanced human compatibility is similarity as compared with how humans conceptualize the world. Concepts can be defined with respect to groundings to human-like primitives such as senses, maintaining human-like concept relationships and spaces (Sotala 2016, [Thorisson et al. 2016a](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-41649-6_11)). Hierarchical structured probabilistic models are one plausible avenue for human-level concept learning ([Lake et al. 2015](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Science-2015-Lake-1332-8.pdf)). One should also aim to understand theoretically and practically how learned representations of high-level human concepts could be expected to generalize, or fail to do so, in radically new contexts ([Tegmark 2015](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW15/paper/download/10149/10138)).
