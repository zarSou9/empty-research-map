### Mini Description

The use of numerical or statistical implicit concepts, reasoning, and computation within systems that use explicit concepts as an interlingua between components

### Description

Systems that aggregate and integrate disparate components using explicit semantic interlingua can use subsymbolic processing for determining what structures, statements, and connections should exist and how they should be weighted ([Hatzilygeroudis and Prentzas 2004](https://ai2-s2-pdfs.s3.amazonaws.com/a2b0/1b08e1ebbc2d42399e58282d615be9bb97ee.pdf)), and can do novel methods of reasoning over them ([Das et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01426)). Though symbolic-first systems have become less popular of late, they are more amenable to integration with the systems that already run society.
