### Description

The meaningful use of symbolic concepts, relationships, constraints, and rules in subsymbolic, typically statistical, e.g. neural net, contexts can help orient deep learning based agents with concepts and relationships its operators care about ([Carmantini et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01926), [Garnelo et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05518), [Velik and Bruckner 2008](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_166316.pdf), [Parisotto et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01855)).
