### Mini Description

Learning to spot ambiguities by leveraging human overseers

### Description

Methods for efficiently scaling up the ability of human overseers to supervise ML systems in scenarios where human feedback is expensive, thus clever strategies are needed for making most efficient use of such resources ([Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)).
