### Description

Given sufficient data, identifying and using the right features in order to model uncertainty well can be approached with bayesian structural analyses of the data ([Liu and Motoda 2007](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=N1ViHNWZeQ0C), [Guo and Schuurmans 2006](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~dale/papers/uai06.pdf), [Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)).
