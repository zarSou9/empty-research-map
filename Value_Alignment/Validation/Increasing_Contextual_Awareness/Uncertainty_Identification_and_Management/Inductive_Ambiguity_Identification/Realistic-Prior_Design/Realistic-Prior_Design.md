### Mini Description

Designing bayesian priors reflecting actual causal structure

### Description

If there is prior knowledge of a domain, bayesian priors can be designed especially to reflect its actual causal structure, reducing ambiguities ([Congdon 2014](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119951518.html), [Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)), and this may be automated. Knowledge-informed expectation propagation can likewise be formulated in non-bayesian formats ([Xu et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05110v1)).
