### Mini Description

Constructing ML components and systems that satisfy well-defined contracts on their behaviors

### Description

To minimize ambiguities at design time, one can construct machine learning systems that satisfy a well-defined contract on their behavior, like in software design ([Liang 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/symposium-algorithms-among-us-percy-liang/), [Bottou 2015](http://icml.cc/2015/invited/LeonBottouICML2015.pdf), [Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565), [Sculley et al. 2014](http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/43146.pdf)).
