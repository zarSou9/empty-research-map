### Mini Description

Techniques to consider, based on logical entailment, what would have happened if the world were different in a certain way, to explore alternatives

### Description

Consideration and reasoning about counterfactual scenarios, or what would have happened if the world were different in a certain way (Neyman 1923, [Rubin 1974](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0037350), [Pearl 2009a](http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/09-SS057)), based on logical entailment but applied in a machine learning context ([Bottou et al. 2012](http://leon.bottou.org/papers/tr-bottou-2012), [Peters et al. 2014](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/peters14a/peters14a.pdf), [Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565), [Swaminathan and Joachims 2015](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2789272.2886805), [Johansson et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03661.pdf), Shalit et al. 2016) enables more accurate, comprehensive, and aligned enumeration and evaluation of options and causal learning. It may be possible to use Garrabrant inductors to predict counterfactuals ([Benson-Tilsen 2016](https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=1054)).
