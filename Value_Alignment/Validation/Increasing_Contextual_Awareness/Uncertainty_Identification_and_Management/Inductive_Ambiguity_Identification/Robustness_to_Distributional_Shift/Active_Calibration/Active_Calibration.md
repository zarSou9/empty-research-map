Pinpointing aspects of a structure that the model is uncertain about

### Description

Active calibration is a technique that helps to pinpoint the structural aspects of most uncertainty within a model ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565), [Werling et al. 2015](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5860-on-the-job-learning-with-bayesian-decision-theory.pdf), [Khani et al. 2016](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1090.pdf)). It is a way of obtaining calibration in structured output settings, as a followup action to recognizing inputs being out-of-distribution ([Kuleshov and Liang 2015](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5658-calibrated-structured-prediction.pdf)).
