### Mini Description

Getting a system trained on one distribution to perform reasonably on a different distribution

### Description

For general robustness of a learning system, one aims to get a system trained on one distribution to perform reasonably when deployed under a different distribution ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)). Deep nets can even incorrectly output very different outputs for only trivially different inputs ([Szegedy et al. 2013](https://cs.nyu.edu/~zaremba/docs/understanding.pdf)). Where applicable, a potential solution is to train on additional subdistributions or variations of a distribution in order to have a more robust model ([Amodei et al. 2016a](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/amodei16.pdf)), but often the nature, direction, or breadth of the drift will be unknown in advance. There are, however, some approaches to learning with concept drift ([Herbster and Warmuth 2001](http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/153244301753683726), [Gama et al. 2004](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sbia/sbia2004.html#GamaMCR04)) in an online context. Multiple research areas relevant to this capability, including change detection, anomaly detection, hypothesis testing, transfer learning, and others ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)). A variety of different statistical techniques can be employed to detect or mitigate these issues ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)). The method of moments, characterizing learned distributions via their top moments, is a partially-specified model technique for assessing instrumental variables ([Anandkumar et al. 2012](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v23/anandkumar12/anandkumar12.pdf), [Hansen 2014](http://larspeterhansen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Uncertainty-Outside-and-Inside-Economic-Models.pdf), [Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)). It enables unsupervised learning, including estimating latent variables, under conditional independence assumptions ([Hansen 1982](http://larspeterhansen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Hansen-econometrica-GMM.pdf), [Powell and Smith-Doerr 1994](http://woodypowell.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/4_NetworksandEconomicLife.pdf)). For well-specified models, online-learning and testing of generative conditional independence structures is another promising avenue for distributional shift robustness ([Merialdo 1994](http://aclweb.org/anthology/J94-2001.pdf), [Nigam et al. 1998](http://www.kamalnigam.com/papers/emcat-aaai98.pdf), [Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565), Cozman and Cohen 2006, [Liang and Klein 2008](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P08-1100), [Li and Zhou 2015](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6710159/)).
