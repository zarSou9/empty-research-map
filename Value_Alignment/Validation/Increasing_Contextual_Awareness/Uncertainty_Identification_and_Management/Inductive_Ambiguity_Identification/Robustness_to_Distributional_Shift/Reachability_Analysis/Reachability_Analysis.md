Bounding controls and disturbances in which system is guaranteed to remain safe if system model is known

### Description

Reachability analysis is a technique for when a system model is known, for bounding controls and disturbances within which the system is guaranteed to remain safe ([Lygeros et al. 1999](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0005-1098(98)00193-9), [Mitchell et al. 2005](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mitchell/Papers/publishedIEEEtac05.pdf)). This aides alleviating situational ambiguity ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)).
