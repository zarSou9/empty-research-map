### Mini Description

Finding a policy that minimizes the downside, or maximizes the utility, of the worst case scenario possible given specific ambiguities

### Description

Once ambiguities are recognized, a potential response is robust policy improvement, finding a policy that minimizes the downside, or alternatively maximizes the utility of the worst case scenario, over that set of ambiguities or distribution of uncertainties ([Wiesemann et al. 2013](http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/moor.1120.0566), [Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)).
