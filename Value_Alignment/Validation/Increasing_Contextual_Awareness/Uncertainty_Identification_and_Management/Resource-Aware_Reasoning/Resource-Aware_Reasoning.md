### Mini Description

Methods for agents to manage their time, memory, compute, and other resources in the process of inference, abduction, and (potentially approximate) deduction

### Description

Given unbounded time and memory, an AI system would be able to figure out both the full distribution of reasonable inferences and the full set of logical entailments that stem from the facts it already knows. Realistic agents, however, have time and memory constraints, and must manage those resources in their activities, including their computations ([Halpern and Pass 2011](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rafael/papers/compdec.pdf), [Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)).
