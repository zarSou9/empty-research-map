### Mini Description

The set of bayesian priors over logical statements that a bounded reasoner can approximate

### Description

The question of how to arrive at a reasonable prior for a logical sentence presents itself when starting induction about logic ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014](http://intelligence.org/files/QuestionsLogicalUncertainty.pdf)). While providing good starting points, it may actually be much less important in the limit ([Garrabrant et al. 2016](http://intelligence.org/files/LogicalInduction.pdf)). In order to address arbitrarily deep combinations of logical uncertainties, however, additional research is needed on what satisfactory set of priors over logical sentences a bounded reasoner can approximate ([Demski 2012](http://ict.usc.edu/pubs/Logical%20Prior%20Probability.pdf), [Christiano 2014b](intelligence.org/files/Non-Omniscience.pdf), [Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)) in practice.
