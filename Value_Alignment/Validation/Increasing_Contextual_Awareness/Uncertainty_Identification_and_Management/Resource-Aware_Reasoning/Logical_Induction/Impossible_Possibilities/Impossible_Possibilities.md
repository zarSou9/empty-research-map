### Description

Exploring how deductively limited reasoners can perform counterpossible reasoning, or counterfactual reasoning from impossible antecedents ([Berto 2013](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2013/entries/impossible-worlds/)), will help progress theory and usage of both counterfactuals and logical induction ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)). This is equivalent to asking how deductively limited reasoners can approximate reasoning according to a probability distribution on complete theories of logic ([Christiano 2014b](intelligence.org/files/Non-Omniscience.pdf)). Early theoretical work has considered counterpossible reasoning in deterministic settings, but further development can aid agent theory and decision theoretic foundations ([Soares and Fallenstein 2015a](https://intelligence.org/files/CounterpossibleReasoning.pdf)).
