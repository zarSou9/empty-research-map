### Mini Description

Reasoning and decision making under bounded computational resources

### Description

Properly budgeting and prioritizing finite resources in order to accomplish any other goals will lead to more robust and higher quality actions ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)). Relatively applied explorations of reasoning and decision making under bounded computational resources have been done ([Horvitz 1987](ftp://131.107.65.22/pub/ejh/u87.pdf), [Russell and Subramanian 1995](https://www.jair.org/media/133/live-133-1446-jair.pdf)), but there is also more theoretical progress needed ([Conitzer and Sandholm 2003](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/complexity_of_metareasoning.ijcai03.pdf), [Conitzer 2011](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/metareasoning)). One class of approaches prominently considers correlations between the bounded agent and its environment ([Halpern and Pass 2011](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rafael/papers/compdec.pdf)). More explicit treatments of practical decision theory under such agents also follows from this ([Halpern et al. 2014](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/papers/rbdec.pdf)). Ongoing progress in unifying structured logic and probability for generalized empirical inference ([Russell 2015](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/cacm15-oupm.pdf)) will aid this capability.
