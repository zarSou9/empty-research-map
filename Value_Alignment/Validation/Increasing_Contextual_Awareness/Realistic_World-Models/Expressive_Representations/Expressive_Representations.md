### Mini Description

Developing structures for world modeling that are sufficiently expressive while remaining computationally efficient

### Description

The structures in which large open world models are modelled will need to be sufficiently expressive while remaining conducive to computational efficiency ([Russell 2015](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/cacm15-oupm.pdf)). Other model desiderata include interpretability, paths to compatibility between separately trained systems, and paths to compatibility between symbolic and subsymbolic representations.

For highly capable systems, the content to fill out such models is too high-volume for humans to fill in directly, so either semisupervised, distantly supervised, or unsupervised learning methods are called for.
