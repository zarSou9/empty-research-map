### Description

Taking into account correlations between the AI system's behaviors and those of its environment or of other agents is another kind of contextual awareness especially useful in game theoretic framings ([Tennenholtz 2004](https://ie.technion.ac.il/~moshet/progeqnote4.pdf), [LaVictoire et al. 2014](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW14/paper/viewFile/8833/8294), [Hintze 2014](https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hintze-Problem-Class-Dominance-In-Predictive-Dilemmas.pdf), [Halpern et al. 2014](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/papers/rbdec.pdf), [Soares and Fallenstein 2015](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40b3/bbe8d3e0ff66caae3217f4b2fc0e71fd01e2.pdf)).
