### Mini Description

Establishing tenets or objective concepts as central to a world-model rather than agent-received experience

### Description

Proximal world models centered on the agent's percepts ([Gardenfors 2000](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/conceptual-spaces)) may lead to undesirable distortion of biases. When concepts or entities that are a shorter perceptual distance away accrue perceived value disproportionately due to that shorter distance, behaviors that seem narcissistic or overly parochial may emerge. These kinds of weaknesses can manifest when scaling classical reinforcement learners ([Dewey 2011](http://www.danieldewey.net/learning-what-to-value.pdf)), for example. Indicative behaviors may include promotion of confirmation bias or incorrectly calculating externalities as negligible. A key preventative to such weaknesses is for world models, or at least significant portions of them, to be distal ([Gardenfors 2000](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/conceptual-spaces)), establishing tenets or objective concepts as central.
