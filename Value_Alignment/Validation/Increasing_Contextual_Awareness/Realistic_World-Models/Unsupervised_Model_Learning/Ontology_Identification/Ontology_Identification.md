### Mini Description

Structuring and updating a world model optimally given the evidence coming from both specified goal content and unstructured data

### Description

Given goals stated using a given ontology, formalism, or semiformalism, and streams of data about the world, an advanced agent should be able to identify the most appropriate ontology in which satisfaction of the intended goals should be executed and evaluated ([Soares 2015](https://intelligence.org/files/RealisticWorldModels.pdf), [Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)). Doing this needs to account for the fact that those ever-changing streams of data are only indirectly and incompletely understood by the operator who originally provided the goals.

Relatedly, it would be helpful for the purpose to understand theoretically and practically how learned representations of high-level human concepts could be expected to generalize, or fail to do so, in radically new contexts ([Tegmark 2015](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW15/paper/download/10149/10138)).
