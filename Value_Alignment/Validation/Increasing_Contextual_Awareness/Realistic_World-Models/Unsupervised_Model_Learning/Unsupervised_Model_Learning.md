### Mini Description

Learning and updating a world model or ontology from unstructured sets and streams of data

### Description

As real-world environments are very large, and supervised tagging of concepts and relationships does not scale, there is great interest in unsupervised model learning. In online contexts, explicit mechanisms are needed to deal with ongoing refactorings of the ontology, or world model, of a system ([Blanc 2011](https://intelligence.org/files/OntologicalCrises.pdf)). The paradigm of maintaining a distribution of possible worlds and determining their likelihoods can be reasonable when those worlds collapse into a tractable number of classes ([Russell et al. 2016](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-1310.pdf), [Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)).

	- Reason: From Unsupervised Model Learning also see Degree of Value Evolution since as new concepts are learned and world models evolve, there are competing pressures to restructure existing values using the updated ontology and to change what set of values to hold to in the first place.

	- Reason: From Unsupervised Model Learning also see World Model Connectedness as that addresses preventing fragmentation to benefit transfer learning and help avoid cognitive dissonance.
