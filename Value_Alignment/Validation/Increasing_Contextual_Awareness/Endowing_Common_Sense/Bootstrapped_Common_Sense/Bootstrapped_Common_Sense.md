### Mini Description

Using unsupervised or very distantly supervised learning to establish semantics from observations and actions

### Description

Abstracting patterns to establish semantics requires a dynamic mix of different reasoning abilities ([Vedantam et al. 2015](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Vedantam_Learning_Common_Sense_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf)).
