Using a core of common sense concepts, relationships, and dynamics as a pretraining or seeding of common sense in order to bootstrap a system

### Description

A core of common sense concepts, relationships, and dynamics can be used as as a pretraining or seeding to bootstrap a system that will learn additional ontology and knowledge around what is seeded ([Cohen et al. 2001](http://www-symbiotic.cs.ou.edu/~fagg/classes/neurocog/restrict/papers/cohen_etal_2001.pdf)). When the core of the relevant contextual landscape can be specified via structured knowledge like this, one can effectively improve the system's contextual awareness by providing a higher quantity and broader scope of usable world-knowledge than one might expect the system to typically need. Abstracting patterns, which has similarities to unsupervised model learning, requires this kind of dynamic mix of reasoning abilities ([Vedantam et al. 2015](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Vedantam_Learning_Common_Sense_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf)).
