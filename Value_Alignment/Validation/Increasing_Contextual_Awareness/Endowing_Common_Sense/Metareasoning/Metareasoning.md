### Mini Description

Reasoning about reasoning, including meta-level control of introspection, computational activities, and models of the self

### Description

Metareasoning, reasoning about reasoning, is an important common sense faculty that includes meta-level control of introspection and of computational activities and modelling the self ([Cox and Raja 2011](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/metareasoning), [Conitzer 2011](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/metareasoning)). It helps to contextualize and modulate common sense reasoning and selection of appropriate algorithms ([Lieder et al. 2014](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5552-global-sensitivity-analysis-for-map-inference-in-graphical-models.pdf)).
