### Mini Description

Endowing agents with common sense knowledge and common sense reasoning will make them more robust and easier to align

### Description

Common sense is often cited as a basic capability that humans have but AI and ML systems lack. Common sense is not a single faculty though, but a combination of extensive world knowledge, deep semantic and pragmatic parsing of percepts, and using the appropriate combination of types of reasoning for the situation ([Freer et al. 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.4799v2), [Lin and Parikh 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.06108v3)).
