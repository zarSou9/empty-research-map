### Mini Description

Making intelligent systems such that they do not spend an inordinate amount of resources determining the trustworthiness or ulterior motives of their operators

### Description

Another instrumental pressure is to constantly scan or prepare for possible ill-intent or possible information leakage. While security precautions and vigilence are important, an arbitrarily high amount of resources can be spent on threat detection and avoidance, while that should typically be tempered to be sufficient to prevent and deal with realistic threats ([Colby 2013](http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/graduate/CMSC671/fall12/resources/colby_71.pdf)).
