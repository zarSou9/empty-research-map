Ensuring the agent doesnt make exploratory moves that have very bad repercussions

### Description

In addition to various types of resource exploitation being potentially unsafe, exploratory moves can also be unsafe if they bring the agent into an unsafe situation. In order to help ensure that the agent doesnt make exploratory moves, in order to learn, that have very bad repercussions, a variety of safe exploration techniques have been discussed ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565), [Garcia and Fernandez 2015](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume16/garcia15a/garcia15a.pdf), [Pecka and Svoboda 2014](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~peckama2/papers/safe_exploration_overview_lncs.pdf)).
