### Mini Description

Using simulations to test different exploration strategies to inform actions in the real world

### Description

One way to explore more is to explore in simulations as much as possible. Agents can then safely incrementally update the policies from imperfect simulation-based trajectories with sufficiently accurate off-policy trajectories using semi-on-policy evaluation ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)). Such techniques can also apply in senses broader than strictly exploration ([Christiano 2016d](https://medium.com/ai-control/learning-with-catastrophes-59387b55cc30)).
