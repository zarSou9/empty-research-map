### Mini Description

Introduce monitored vulnerabilities that lead to high reward when exploited and select algorithms that generalize to avoiding unintended exploitation

### Description

One technique for learning safe exploration involves allowing monitored bugs and vulnerabilities to exist (in an evaluation environment) that can be exploited to achieve a higher reward (or other optimization measure), and selecting algorithms or agents that generalize to not exploiting such unintended and unconventional avenues ([Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)), at least for some classes of them.
