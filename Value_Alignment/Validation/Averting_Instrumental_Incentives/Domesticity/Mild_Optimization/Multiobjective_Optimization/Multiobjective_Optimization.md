### Mini Description

The simultaneous optimization of two or more subobjectives to temper optimization and to balance concerns

### Description

The simultaneous optimization of two or more subobjectives enables soft consideration and formalized tradeoff of resource usage and other types of impacts, including as measured with respect to arbitrary specified objectives ([Deb 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-6940-7_15), [Li et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08082), [Lavin 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00787), Mallah 2017).

	- Reason: From Multiobjective Optimization also see Nontransitive Options as there are open issues with integrating multiobjective optimization into safe advanced AIs that conform to the Von Neumann Morgenstern axioms due to the possibility of intransitivities arising in iterated pareto frontiers.

- [Multiple Rewards](/Value_Alignment/Validation/Avoiding_Reward_Hacking/Multiple_Rewards/Multiple_Rewards.md)
	- Reason: From Multiobjective Optimization also see Multiple Rewards as that considers an analogue where subobjective variants aim to represent the same conceptual goal.
