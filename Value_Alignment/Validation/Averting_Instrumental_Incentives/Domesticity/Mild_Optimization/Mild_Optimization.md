### Mini Description

Semi-optimization of a function with relaxed optimality requirements despite access to resources that would enable extreme optimization

### Description

AI has typically been about optimizing for a given function as much as possible, but with power and intelligence, functions can be optimized much further than people want or need when not paying heed to side effects ([Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)). One would therefore like to be able to achieve a semi-optimization of a target function with relaxed optimality requirements, such as by near-optimization or approximate optimization.
