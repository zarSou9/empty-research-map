### Mini Description

Maintaining a model of uncertainty about the importance of underexplored entities, relationships, and dynamics

### Description

Maintaining dynamic bayesian uncertainty regarding the importance or value of unexplored and underexplored or uncharacterized entities, relationships, and dynamics can significantly effect humble treatment of others ([Srivastava et al. 2914](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/uai14-oupomdp.pdf), [Mallah 2014](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/research/future/mallah-aamas14-future.pdf)). Reasonable multilevel aggregation would be needed to deal with constructs of varying temporal, physical, and complexity scales ([Snijders and Bosker 2011](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/multilevel-analysis/book234191), Mallah 2017).
