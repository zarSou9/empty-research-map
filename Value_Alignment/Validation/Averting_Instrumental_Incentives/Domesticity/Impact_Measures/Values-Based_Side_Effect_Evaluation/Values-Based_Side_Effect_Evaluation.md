### Mini Description

Techniques to evaluate prospective side effects based on core and compound values

### Description

More explicit approaches to avoiding negative side effects, combining common sense reasoning and evaluation of scenarios with respect to values, offer an integrative approach with other aspects of safety and alignment ([Steunebrink et al. 2016](http://people.idsia.ch/~steunebrink/Publications/AGI16_growing_recursive_self-improvers.pdf), [Greene et al. 2016](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12457/12204)). Such techniques can evaluate prospective side effects based on core, compound, and instrumental values in a consequentialist manner.
