### Mini Description

Penalizing an agent for changing the world as per measures learned from similar past experiences

### Description

Instead of using predefined measures, an agent can learn transferrable side effects across multiple tasks in similar environments ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)), similar in mechanism to transferring just learned dynamics ([Taylor and Stone 2009](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume10/taylor09a/taylor09a.pdf)). This would help it learn to characterize and quantify expected, relevant, and unexpected environmental changes.
