Penalizing empowerment or some similar metric of being in a position to cause side effects

### Description

One way to prevent future abuse of power is to minimize the amount of power needed to accomplish the prescribed task, i.e. penalizing empowerment or some other metric of being in a position to cause side effects ([Salge et al. 2014](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d01e/3414ca706eda917576d947ece811b5cbcdde.pdf), [Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)). As this is essentially the opposite of the type of objective function often used for intrinsic motivation ([Mohamed and Rezende 2015](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5668-variational-information-maximisation-for-intrinsically-motivated-reinforcement-learning.pdf)) further study is needed on viable formulations of the idea. It has however also been noted that reinforcement learning techniques which punish the agent for attempting to accumulate control would actually incentivize the agent to deceive and appease its creators or operators until it found a way to gain a decisive advantage ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf), [Bostrom 2014](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/superintelligence-9780199678112)).
