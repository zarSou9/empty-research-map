Ways to ensure an agent won't disturb the environment in negative ways while pursuing its goals, ideally without specifying in advance what not to disturb

### Description

If possible, one should aim to ensure that the agent won't disturb the environment in specifically *negative* ways while pursuing its goals, as opposed to in any way at all, and we'd ideally like to do so without specifying what not to disturb ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)).
