Safely incentivizing an intelligent agent to be low-impact to the world

### Description

The optimizers of today do not annex or use excessive resources not because doing so wouldn't lead to more optimal solutions to the function they're optimizing, but because they lack the capability to annex resources. This will change as AI becomes more general in its capabilities. It has been argued that explicitly and safely incentivizing such an intelligent agent to be low-impact on its environment will therefore be necessary ([Armstrong et al. 2012](www.nickbostrom.com/papers/oracle.pdf), [Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)).
