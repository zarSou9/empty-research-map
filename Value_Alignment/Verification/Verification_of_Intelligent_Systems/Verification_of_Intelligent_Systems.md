### Mini Description

Applying verification techniques to indirectly specified systems that learn and act intelligently

### Description

Additional challenges with the verification of artificial intelligence and machine learning software come from the fact that behavior is more determined by data as compared to concentional software. To verify such systems, one needs not only provably correct implementations of the system's algorithms (given specifications of those algorithms), but also of the models they learn ([Seshia et al. 2016](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dsadigh/Papers/seshia-verifiedAI-arxiv.pdf)).: introspective environment modeling, end-to-end specifications and specification mining, developing abstractions for and explanations from ML components, creating new randomized formal methods for systematically generating realistic data, and developing verification engines more oriented around run time, quantitative operations, and learning ([Seshia et al. 2016](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dsadigh/Papers/seshia-verifiedAI-arxiv.pdf)).
