### Mini Description

Automated whitebox techniques for bug finding and security vulnerability finding

### Description

Most systems today are not developed with correct-by-construction methodologies but rather are programmed directly. While techniques for attempting to verify such systems exist, there are many aspects and constructs they cannot cope with ([DSilva et al. 2008](http://www.kroening.com/papers/tcad-sw-2008.pdf)), often due to their dynamicity, but even some formal proofs may be unverifiable ([Yampolskiy 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00331v3)). Given such less-formally specified systems, automated bug and vulnerability finding by abstract static analysis ([DSilva et al. 2008](http://www.kroening.com/papers/tcad-sw-2008.pdf)) and static application security testing ([Brucker and Sodan 2014](https://www.brucker.ch/bibliography/download/2014/brucker.ea-sast-expierences-2014.pdf)) in conjunction with dynamic testing, is a next best technique for reducing implementation errors.
