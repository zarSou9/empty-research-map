Assembly of more compound software that combines pre-verified components

### Description

The assembly of more compound software that combines pre-verified components greatly eases the use of correct-by-construction techniques ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)). If theories of extending verifiable properties from components to entire systems hold, then even very extensive systems can hold certain kinds of safety guarantees, potentially aided by techniques designed explicitly to handle the higher-level semantic, behavioral, and distributional properties (Russell and Norvig 2010) of AI and ML systems. Modular systems of formal mathematics ([Mahboubi and Tassi 2013](http://ssr.msr-inria.inria.fr/doc/tutorial-itp13/slides.pdf), [Rouhling et al. 2015](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01107944)) can serve both as a model for, and as a resource in creating, such modular verified frameworks and components.
