Creating reliable systems that have parameters that vary or are initially unknown

### Description

Systems that interact with the external world, such as cybersecurity systems and trading agents, necessarily have parameters that vary or are initially unknown. The field of adaptive control theory addresses design of such systems and serves as a step in the direction of the AI systems being addressed in this landscape guide ([AAstr"om and Wittenmark 2013](http://store.doverpublications.com/0486462781.html)). Some work has been done on verification of such systems ([Crespo et al. 2010](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100031105.pdf)), and may help inform verification of more sophisticated learning systems ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)).
