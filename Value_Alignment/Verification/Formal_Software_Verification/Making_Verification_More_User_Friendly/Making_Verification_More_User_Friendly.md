Make it easier for engineers to create and understand verified systems

### Description

Creating verified or correct-by-construction software has a much higher overhead as compared with unverified software ([Ouimet and Lundqvist 2007](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c593/e5fc056b519cd43b5fdf033eb3281cd74983.pdf)). Creating methodologies, algorithms, tools, and cultures around creating verified software with the aim of making it easier for software developers to decide to use these methods would be quite worthwhile. While verification based on theorem provers can scale to larger systems than ones based on model checkers can, and the former can also reason inductively where the latter is unable to ([Ouimet and Lundqvist 2007](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c593/e5fc056b519cd43b5fdf033eb3281cd74983.pdf)), theorem provers pose usability issues for systems of realistic size. The proofs created by such verification systems for software of practical size are unfortunately quite unweildy ([Ouimet and Lundqvist 2007](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c593/e5fc056b519cd43b5fdf033eb3281cd74983.pdf)), calling for easier ways to explore, summarize, check, and query them. There are also a number of relevant open problems with proof verifiers ([Yampolskiy 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00331v3)) that can impact their use on AI.
