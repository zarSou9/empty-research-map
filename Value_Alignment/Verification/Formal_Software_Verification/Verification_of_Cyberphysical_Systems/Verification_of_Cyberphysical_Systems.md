### Mini Description

Applying verification techniques to systems that have both physical components and software components, operating in the physical world

### Description

When the external world that agents interact with is the physical world, further complications come into play. It is often difficult to actually apply formal verification techniques to physical systems, especially systems that have not been designed specifically to support verification. This has motivated research seeking a general theory linking functional specifications to physical states of the world ([Platzer 2010](https://www.isr.umd.edu/sites/default/files/110919_Platzer.pdf)), usually confined to the area surrounding the system. This type of theory would allow use of formal tools to anticipate and control behaviors of systems that approximate rational agents, alternate designs such as satisficing agents, and systems that cannot be easily described in the standard agent formalism (powerful prediction systems, theorem provers, limited-purpose science or engineering systems, and so on, [Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)). Such a theory may also allow rigorous demonstrations that a system is prevented or constrained from performing certain kinds of reasoning or taking certain kinds of actions ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)). The application of reachability analysis and hybrid discrete/continuous dynamics to the formal verification of computational physical entities operating in physical spaces seem promising ([Platzer 2010](https://www.isr.umd.edu/sites/default/files/110919_Platzer.pdf), [Alur 2011](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/EmsoftSurvey11.pdf), [Winfield et al. 2014](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5608/b9ed2454a8788d0ecaab9a10d87b78125d70.pdf), [Jeannin et al. 2015](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jeannin/papers/acasx.pdf), [Loos et al. 2013](http://symbolaris.com/pub/discworld.pdf), [Mitsch et al. 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCPS.2012.25), [Mitsch et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00604), [Alur 2015](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/principles-cyber-physical-systems)), as does extending the introspection and proof capabilities of differential dynamic logic ([Fulton and Platzer 2016](http://nfulton.org/papers/lpdl.pdf)).
