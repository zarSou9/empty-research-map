### Mini Description

How formal systems of verification techniques can be used for generating robust superior successors

### Description

A related verification research topic that is a distinctive long-term concern is the verifiability of systems that modify, extend, or improve themselves, successors, or descendant programs, quite possibly many times in succession ([Good 1965](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065245808604180), [Vinge 1993](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html), [Yampolskiy 2015](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06512)). Attempting to straightforwardly apply formal verification tools to this more general setting presents new difficulties ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf)). With many potential approaches, a formal system that is sufficiently powerful cannot use formal methods in the obvious way to gain assurance about the accuracy of functionally similar formal systems, due to Gödel's incompleteness theorems ([Fallenstein and Soares 2014](https://intelligence.org/files/ProblemsSelfReference.pdf), [Weaver 2013](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.3626.pdf)). There has, however, been recent progress in modeling theorem prover verification systems in themselves, specifically illustrated with model polymorphism, cleverly circumventing the Gödellian obstacle ([Fallenstein and Kumar 2015](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rk436/itp2015a.pdf)).
