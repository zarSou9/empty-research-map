Techniques to enable operators to monitor and control an advanced agent, and giving them the knowledge they need to do so in an informed manner

### Description

Oversight techniques aim to enable operators to effectively monitor, direct, and control an advanced agent, and give them the knowledge they need to do so in an informed manner. These techniques can be largely applicable in the case when the operator is another artificial agent as well, given sufficiently advanced AI. Researchers are driven to ask questions like how one might train a reinforcement learning system to take actions that aid an intelligent overseer, such as a human, in accurately assessing the systems performance ([Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)). This exposes challenges such as supervising machine learning systems in scenarios where they are complex and even potentially deceptive.
