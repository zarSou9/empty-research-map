### Mini Description

Techniques by which one algorithm can control what a third-party algorithm does

### Description

As time progresses and agents become sufficiently advanced, automatic generation of subagents may well occur. While trivial with simple fixed algorithms, there is currently extremely little research on the general case of how one algorithm can control another one with potentially independent optimization criteria (Critch 2016b).
