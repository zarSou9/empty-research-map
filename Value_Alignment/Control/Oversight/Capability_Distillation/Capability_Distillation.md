### Mini Description

Techniques to extract another agent's or system's capabilities and learn a compact representation of them to within some tolerance

### Description

Being able to distill or crystalize the capabilities, knowledge ([Hinton et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02531v1)), and skills ([Kaiser and Sutskever 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08228v3)) of one system into another more compact one, or a less capable one, at least to within some tolerance, would be useful for many of the approaches to oversight and control. For applicability to long-term AI safety, being able to learn these in the face of much scarcer feedback containing possible inconsistencies would seem to be necessary and requires more research ([null](https://medium.com/ai-control/approval-directed-algorithm-learning-bf1f8fad42cd)).
