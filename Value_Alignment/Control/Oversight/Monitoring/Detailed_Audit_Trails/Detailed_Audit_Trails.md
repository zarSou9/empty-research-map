### Description

To provide avenues for tracking and understanding of automated decisions retrospectively, protected and detailed logging mechanisms comparable to the black box of an aircraft are an option. Making such audit trails effective would require improving techniques to identify, prioritize, filter, summarize, retain, protect, organize, and make easily-consumable information about everything an agent encounters, infers, deduces, or decides ([Presnell et al. 2007](https://simbionic.com/papers/IITSEC-07-behavior-modeling.pdf)).
