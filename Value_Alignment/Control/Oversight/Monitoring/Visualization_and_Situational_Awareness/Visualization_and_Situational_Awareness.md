Methods to provide context and salient operational information to a human operator as completely and efficiently as possible

### Description

An understanding of the context and other salient operational information is key for a human operator monitoring the state of an AI. Methods to provide such situational awareness as completely and efficiently as possible would aid monitoring significantly. Situational awareness includes the broader context as the AI sees it, a representation of the environment, auto-selected salient factors for decision making and their recent and projected values, characterizations of risk sensitivity, and the top reasons for both recent decisions and upcoming decisions ([Lent et al. 2004](http://ict.usc.edu/pubs/An%20Explainable%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20System%20for%20Small-unit%20Tactical%20Behavior.pdf)).
