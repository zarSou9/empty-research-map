Methods for determining the sufficient amount of information to report to a human

### Description

Quite a high volume of sensory and other data, computations involving processing intermediate values, and decisions of all sizes, will be present in any but the most trivial of agents. Specialized techniques are therefore required for determining the proper or sufficient amount of information to report to a human for them to be adequately informed but not overwhelmed. In the context of reporting on judgement, explaining the major factors that went into the decision and what would have to have been different for a different decision ([Janzing et al. 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/13-AOS1145)) might qualify, but the optimal level of detail will likely vary by application or context. The question arises as to the appropriate circumstances in which to produce a maximally informative report even when such an interpretable report necessarily impinges the accuracy or reliability of decisions made ([Christiano 2016c](https://medium.com/ai-control/the-informed-oversight-problem-1b51b4f66b35)). The agent would ideally determine the salience, risk, or uncertainty of a situation or a decision and modulate its introspection, logging, and reporting volume upward during times when those are elevated; furthermore, it could also modulate where, based on similar factors and operator expectations, on the pareto frontier between accuracy and interpretability to be ([Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)). When the report itself is interactive, such as via a dialogue, there is less uncertainty about sufficiency because humans can drill down for more detail where needed ([Perera et al. 2016](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/papers/16roman-verbalization.pdf)), so long as it has been logged in depth internally.
