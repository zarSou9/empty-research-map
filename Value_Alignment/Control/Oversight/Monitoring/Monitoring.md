### Mini Description

Techniques such as transparency, interpretability, or reporting to facilitate human understanding of the state, history, and environment of an agent

### Description

Monitoring, such as transparency or interpretability, can, to a degree ([Lipton 2016](http://zacklipton.com/media/papers/mythos-model-interpretability_16.pdf)), help humans or other agents understand what an agent is doing, why it is doing it, and what alternatives it has considered ([Muehlhauser 2013](https://intelligence.org/2013/08/25/transparency-in-safety-critical-systems/)).
