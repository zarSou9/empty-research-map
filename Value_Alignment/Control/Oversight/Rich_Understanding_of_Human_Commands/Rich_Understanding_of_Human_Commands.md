### Mini Description

Methods for effective, robust, and meaningful communication between humans and machines

### Description

Though some advanced approaches aim to put the full burden of diambiguating humans on the intelligent agent, methods for effective, robust, meaningful, and minimally ambiguous communication between humans and machines ([DARPA 2015](http://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2015-02-20)) may well be necessary. It has been argued, however, that agents with different world models and only symbolic serialization between face very high computational complexity when statically attempting exhaustive disambiguation ([Hu 2011](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=miami1323323230&disposition=inline), [Ivanova 2012](http://www.igi-global.com/article/ontology-alignment-state-art-main/48843)).
