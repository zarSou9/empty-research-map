### Mini Description

A technique where human-agent interaction is modeled as a cooperative game where both players attempt to find a joint policy that maximizes the humans secret value function

### Description

The cooperative inverse reinforcement learning paradigm views the human-agent interaction as a cooperative game where both players attempt to find a joint policy that maximizes the humans secret value function ([Hadfield-Menell et al. 2016](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dhm/papers/CIRL_NIPS_16.pdf), [Taylor et al. 2016](https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf)). An outstanding challenge in this is to determine which portions of the ascertained value function are instrumental, which are incidental, and which exhibit deep values.
