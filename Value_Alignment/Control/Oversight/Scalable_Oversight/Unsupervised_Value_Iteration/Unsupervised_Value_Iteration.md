### Mini Description

Using observed transitions within unlabeled episodes to make more accurate updates to the modeled reward function

### Description

The technique of unsupervised value iteration may also be useful for scalable oversight. This involves using the observed transitions within unlabeled episodes to make more accurate Bellman updates in the context of a markov decision process ([Amodei et al. 2016](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565)).
