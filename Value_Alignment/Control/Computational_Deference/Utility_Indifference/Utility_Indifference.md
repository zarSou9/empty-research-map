Techniques to make an agent structurally indifferent to having its objective function switched

### Description

A powerful AI should be structurally indifferent to having its objective function switched out by valid operators ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)). An ongoing area of research is how a utility function can be specified such that agents maximizing that utility function switch their preferences on demand, without having incentives to cause or prevent the switching ([Armstrong 2010](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/utility-indifference.pdf), [Armstrong 2015a](http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW15/paper/viewFile/10183/10126)).
