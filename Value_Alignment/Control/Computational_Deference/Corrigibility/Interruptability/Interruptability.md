Having a powerful agent safely and unbiasedly accept interruption or shut down commands by an operator

### Description

Interruptability, being able to have a powerful agent safely and unbiasedly accept interruption or shut down commands by an operator, may be aided by having the system include control information about itself when modeling what its operator wants ([Hadfield-Menell et al. 2016a](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08219v1)), or may be accomplished by targeted supression of relevant training signals ([Orseau and Armstrong 2016](http://auai.org/uai2016/proceedings/papers/68.pdf)).
