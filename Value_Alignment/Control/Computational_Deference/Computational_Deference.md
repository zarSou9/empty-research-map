How to get powerful artificial agents to choose to respect the intent of their operators

### Description

Researchers argue that powerful artificial agents should choose to respect and submit themselves to their operators. When there is a tight coupling in such AI-operator systems, this requires factoring the human's behavior in more ([Amershi et al. 2014](www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2513/2456)) e.g. issues with alerting non-alert user to take over driving self-driving car ([Ohn-Bar and Trivedi 2016](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/eshed/papers/humansTIV.pdf)). Another type of deference would be in service of stabilizing or averting activities that would noticably result in the environment changing to accomodate the agent ([Hammond et al. 1995](http://ac.els-cdn.com/000437029400006M/1-s2.0-000437029400006M-main.pdf?_tid=9424cbbc-c4e4-11e6-b2ae-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1482039849_945550ec80cbdf0e7fd039ef161a2f13)). Those activities are another manifestation of Goodhart's Law ([Manheim 2016](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/06/09/goodharts-law-and-why-measurement-is-hard/)).

	- Reason: From Computational Deference also see Computational Humility as limiting an agent's estimation of its own importance can be an important prerequisite to holding its operators in relatively high esteem.
- [Mild Optimization](/Value_Alignment/Validation/Averting_Instrumental_Incentives/Domesticity/Mild_Optimization/Mild_Optimization.md)
	- Reason: From Computational Deference also see Mild Optimization because developing a formal model of Goodharts Law can also benefit that need.
