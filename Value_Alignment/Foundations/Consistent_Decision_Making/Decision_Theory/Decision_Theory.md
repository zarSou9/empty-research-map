The mathematical study of strategies for optimal decision-making

### Description

Decision theory, the mathematical study of strategies for optimal decision-making between options involving different risks or expectations of gain or loss, has been long studied ([Pearl 2000](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/pref.html)), but existing methods are not robust, especially with regard to counterfactual reasoning. Mathematical tools such as formal logic, probability, and decision theory have yielded significant insight into the foundations of reasoning and decision making. However, there are still many open problems in the foundations of reasoning and decision ([Soares and Fallenstein 2015](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40b3/bbe8d3e0ff66caae3217f4b2fc0e71fd01e2.pdf)), and solutions to these problems may make the behavior of very capable systems much more reliable and predictable ([Russell et al. 2015](http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf), [Benson-Tilsen 2014](http://intelligence.org/files/UDTSearchOrder.pdf)). Developing a general theory of highly reliable decision-making, even if it is too idealized to be directly implemented, gives us the conceptual tools needed to design and evaluate safe heuristic approaches ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf), [Soares and Fallenstein 2015](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40b3/bbe8d3e0ff66caae3217f4b2fc0e71fd01e2.pdf)).
