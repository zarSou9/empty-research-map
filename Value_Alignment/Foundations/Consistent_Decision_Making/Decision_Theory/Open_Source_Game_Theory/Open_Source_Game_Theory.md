### Mini Description

Optimal decision making in a multiagent environment where agents can see each other's source code, useful for modeling one agent controlling another

### Description

Game theory becomes qualitatively different when players are translucent ([Halpern and Pass 2013](http://www.tark.org/proceedings/tark_jan7_13/p216-halpern.pdf)) or transparent to each other. Open source game theory, optimal decision making in a multiagent environment where agents can see each other's source code, is useful for the modeling of one agent controlling another ([Critch 2016](http://acritch.com/media/ai/Andrew_Critch_-_Parametric_Bounded_Lob.pdf), [Tennenholtz 2004](https://ie.technion.ac.il/~moshet/progeqnote4.pdf)). One key goal of this area is to find ways to foster robust cooperation between agents ([Barasz et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5577v1), [Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)). It is also particularly useful for scenarios where one agent will be creating another agent that is to be trusted.
