### Mini Description

Foundations and methods for abstractly reasoning about and predicting what a generally more capable agent would do

### Description

Reasoning about and prediction of what the prospective superior agent would do requires a more viable approach than computing all possible action paths ([Yudkowsky and Herreshoff 2013](http://intelligence.org/files/TilingAgents.pdf)). Agents must abstractly reason about agents which are smarter than themselves, without attempting to replicate the full processes of the superior agent, highly leveraging a rich landscape of counterfactuals ([Vinge 1993](http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html), [Fallenstein and Soares 2015](https://intelligence.org/files/VingeanReflection.pdf), [Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)).
