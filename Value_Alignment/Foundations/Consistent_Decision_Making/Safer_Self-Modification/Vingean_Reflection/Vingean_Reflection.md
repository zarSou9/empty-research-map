### Mini Description

Formalized logic to reason about the correctness of self-modifications

### Description

If a system will attain superintelligence through self-improvement, then the impact of the system depends entirely upon the correctness of the original agents reasoning about its self-modifications, and the subsequent ability of its successor to do the same ([Fallenstein and Soares 2015](https://intelligence.org/files/VingeanReflection.pdf), [Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)). Generally when one requires extremely high reliability today, implementation-verifiable formal logic based systems are used. Formalized logic to reason about the correctness of self-modifications or prospectively generated superior successors is termed Vingean reflection ([Fallenstein and Soares 2015](https://intelligence.org/files/VingeanReflection.pdf)).
