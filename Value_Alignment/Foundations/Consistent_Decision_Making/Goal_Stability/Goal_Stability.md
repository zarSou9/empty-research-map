Techniques to maintain the stability of goals in the face of pressures to change them

### Description

The maintenance of stability in the objectives of an advanced agent is challenging ([LaVictoire 2015](https://agentfoundations.org/item?id=130), [Muehlhauser and Williamson 2013](https://intelligence.org/files/IdealAdvisorTheories.pdf)). Methods for safer self-modification can be used to help maintain goal stability in systems that self-improve. When a static objective is acceptable, e.g. for some for short-to-medium-lived agents, one would want mechanisms to maintain the stability of the overall goals while providing flexibility as to situationally appropriate subobjective priority.
