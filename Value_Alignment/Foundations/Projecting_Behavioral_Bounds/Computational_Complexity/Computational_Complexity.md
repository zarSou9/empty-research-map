### Description

It may be possible to characterize or bound the time or resources particular algorithms or capabilities would require, both in their exact and approximate forms (Selman 2017). Understanding upper, average, and lower time and resource bounds regarding particular types of functionality would be useful for purposes of projecting risks and weighing tradeoffs ([Kosoy 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04112v4)). Typically such analyses are done by algorithm designers upfront, but enabling advanced systems to do this analysis well themselves can help tighten the estimates of resources required for specific actions, leading to more robust decisions.
