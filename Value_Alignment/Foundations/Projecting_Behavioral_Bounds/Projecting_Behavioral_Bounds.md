### Mini Description

Methods by which developers or operators can determine the theoretical bounds or maximum capabilities of a system

### Description

In order to assess risks, it is helpful to understand the theoretical limits on the capabilities being considered (Selman 2017). One can understand the theoretical upper and lower limits of a class of agents without needing to know the details of their architecture ([Zhang et al. 2014](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/530a/1373abd714070cb9b65ab6534216b98512f5.pdf)). For advanced agents, the methods by which developers or operators can determine the theoretical bounds or maximum capabilities of a system include proofs stemming from its architecture and communication of the state of the system.
