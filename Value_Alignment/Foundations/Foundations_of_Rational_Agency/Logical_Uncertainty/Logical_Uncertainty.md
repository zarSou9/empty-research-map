### Mini Description

The state of not knowing, or not yet knowing, the full set of logical entailments of facts that are already known

### Description

There are different types of uncertainty, with the most common type being the known unknowns of empirical uncertainty ([Russell 2015](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/cacm15-oupm.pdf)). Given significantly less attention than merited by its foundational utility has been logical uncertainty, which addresses the unknown knowns of potentially voluminous entailments of things already known ([Soares and Fallenstein 2014](http://intelligence.org/files/QuestionsLogicalUncertainty.pdf)). Just as one can apply deduction about some inductive steps and entailments, one can oftentimes conversely apply induction to expectations about deductions ([Halpern 2003](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reasoning-about-uncertainty), [Hutter et al. 2013](http://www.hutter1.net/publ/sproblogic.pdf), [Demski 2012](http://ict.usc.edu/pubs/Logical%20Prior%20Probability.pdf), [Russell 2014a](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-08795-5_2)). Logical uncertainty is actually implied, but sorely underanalyzed, in domains such as probability, bayesian reasoning, game theory, and economics, since there are sequences of deductive thinking steps involved ([Soares 2016a](https://intelligence.org/2016/04/21/two-new-papers-uniform/)). Logical uncertainty bridges rational choice theory and probability theory, combining logic and observation and their respective time-embedded epistemic uncertainties ([Demski 2012](http://ict.usc.edu/pubs/Logical%20Prior%20Probability.pdf), [Soares and Fallenstein 2014a](http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf)).
