### Mini Description

A theoretical first-principles framework for artificial general intelligence

### Description

Universal algorithmic intelligence is a theoretical design for an artificial general intelligence that describes a reinforcement learner combining Solomonoff induction and sequential decision theory ([Hutter 2007](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0701125v1), [Hutter 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.6153v1)). Though its original formulation with optimality guarantees has very impactical computational complexity, there are approximations ([Veness et al. 2010](http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2049)) of the algorithm that can be computed, and variants oriented toward more typical AI capabilities ([Potapov et al. 2012](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.4290v1)). There has even been serious exploration as to making it learn values and be empathetic ([Potapov and Rodionov 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0702v1)). It's also used in the seminal measure of algorithmic intelligence, universal intelligence ([Legg and Hutter 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11023-007-9079-x)). Because of its theoretical simplicity, this paradigm may be most useful for establishing bounds and theoretical limits of reinforcement learners or artificial agents more generally.
