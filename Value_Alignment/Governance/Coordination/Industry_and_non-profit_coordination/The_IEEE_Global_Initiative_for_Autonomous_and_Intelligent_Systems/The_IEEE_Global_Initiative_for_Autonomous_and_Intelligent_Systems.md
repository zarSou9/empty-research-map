### Mini Description

The IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization for the advancement of technology. This new initiative is tasked with exploring legal, safety, and ethical issues relating to AI and robots.

### Description

The IEEE Global Initiative for Autonomous and Intelligent Systems developed a set of AI standards in November 2017 to address metrics for ensuring human wellbeing, developing methodologies to achieve ethically-driven nudging parameters, and establishing fail-safe mechanisms in autonomous and semi-autonomous systems (IEEE, 2017). The group also produced a report titled Ethically Aligned Design.
