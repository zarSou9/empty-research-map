### Mini Description

Governance is broader than the direct reach of governments; it represents the norms and values held by society, which are structured through various formal and informal processes of decision-making to ensure accountability, stability, broad participation, and the rule of law.

### Description

How we choose to govern technological and social developments stems from the values we hold. Governance can play a key role in enabling value alignment between humans and machines, as well as in determining what and whose values will be implemented into law and practice, and how this will be carried out. Technologies themselves also structure and govern our world through silent, but powerful influence (Jasanoff, 2016). Governance can be broken down into three interrelated categories: coordination, policy, and law.
